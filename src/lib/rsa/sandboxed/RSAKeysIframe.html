    have to be sent as response headers. Additionally, as sandboxed iframes have a null origin, imported scripts are
    loaded as cross-origin requests, for which proper cors headers whitelisting the null origin would need to be set on
    the server. However, some ad-blockers also block cross-origin requests of files from Nimiq's domain to historically
    block mining on third party websites. To circumvent these cross-origin issues, we inline the scripts during the
    build process. -->
